              <p>Hello, I am Catherine Ricafort. I have been working since i was 19 years old. I started working in a call center as a customer service representative. I, too, worked as a technical support representative for a Laptop and ISP provider. I got promoted as a Quality Analyst for a healthcare account before i became an Email Marketing Analyst for a company based in the U.S. I have been working from home for 6 years now. I have started getting full and part time jobs and i was able to manage my time properly. None of my tasks are being affected due to multiple workloads.</p>
              <p> Although i was not able to finish my degree, i have been getting skills from the jobs that i'm getting. I am really grateful for the employers that hired me regardless if i have the required skills or not. They believed in me and trusted me. Trained and molded me to become a better employee everyday. The skills that i have, i owe them to all the people that trusted me throughout the years.</p><p>Please email me at <strong>catherine.ricafort@yahoo.com</strong></p>

              <p>This is my first Email Marketing job. The company has trained me to use all of the marketing tools i need to complete the job. This is also where i started using html and photoshop. Part of the job is to create display ads for the auction houses. We are using Adobe Photoshop to finish the design and we have droplets too. I am always grateful that i am part of a healthy and caring company like Invaluable Business Analytics.</p>

              <p>This is one of my part-time jobs. Actually, this is an on-call job. The operator will just contact me if she needs a banner or social media post design. This is a motorcycle courier app in the Philippines. This is an easy and fun job.</p>

              <p>This is a part-time job that i had. My boss was sending us a ticket with all of the details needed for the banner or social media post. We were creating design ads for the cleaning business of our Boss. It was a chill and exciting job however, due to the pandemic, the business needs to close until further notice. This is where i started using Canva. I had no experience in designing but the company trusted me. They trained me to become a graphic designer.</p>

              <p>This is my first job. I started as a customer service representative. We were assisting customers to fill out their forms. This was for a money-transfer company. After 6 months of taking in calls, i got promoted as a Quality Analyst but was transferred to a Healthcare account. I was monitoring the calls of the agents to make sure that they were following the guidelines set by our clients. We were also sending reports to their supervisors to help them improve their scores.</p>
