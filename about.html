                  <h3>The Story of my Life</h3>
                  <p>I have been working since i was 19 years old. I was not able to finish my degree because i need to get a full time job to help my family. I started working in a call center as a customer service representative. I, too, worked as a technical support representative for a Laptop and ISP provider. I got promoted as a Quality Analyst for a healthcare account before i became an Email Marketing Analyst for a company based in the U.S. I have been working from home for 6 years now. I have started getting full and part time jobs and i was able to manage my time properly. </p>
                  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                  <p>I really love spending time with my dogs. Annoying and cuddling them is my favorite hobby! I also love to play PC and mobile games during my free time. Nowadays, I'm starting to like signing up to online classes. I am currently studying Web Development in Udemy and i also signed up for the Harvard University's free Computer Science online course. I guess we're all craving for knowledge as time goes by. I love watching movies and series too. I have watched Harry Potter movies for hundereds of times now! I love making coffee too. Maybe i really want to be a Barista someday and build my own coffee shop.  
                  <h3>Lessons I've Learned</h3>
                  <p>
                  Throughout the years, i learned that sometimes, when life's getting hard, you just need to see the silver linings in it. You need to see the light when things get dark. Don't forget to have fun while you're busy achieving your goal. If you want to add extra happiness to your life, get or adopt a dog now!</p>
